## Duplicate Image Detection 
Detect duplicate images in a large dataset of planted trees. 

### Current Tasks: 
- compare image hashing algorithms on larger image set
- compare feature-detection based methods 

## Image Update Detection   
Identify the same tree over its lifespan. 

### Current Tasks: 
- how to incorporate geographic knowledge, species/taxonomic/ecological id
- 

## Image Blurring Detection
Make sure submitted images are identifiable

### Current Tasks: 
- Determine LoG variance/max thresholds
- Research localized methods (i.e. after background subtraction, SVD denoising?)
