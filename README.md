This private repository contains code for Greenstand's image analysis processes. Here are a few broad goals we are currently working on or hope to achieve in the future:
- duplicate image detection
- tree growth/update tracking
- image quality analysis (visibility)
- automated species tagging
- automated plant disease identification

Progress on these issues will be tracked in the Projects section of the repository.
