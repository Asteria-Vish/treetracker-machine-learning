### Current Tasks: 
- compare image hashing algorithms on larger image set
- compare feature-detection based methods 

## Image Update Detection   
Identify the same tree over its lifespan. 

### Current Tasks: 
- how to incorporate geographic knowledge, species/taxonomic/ecological id


## Image Blurring Detection
Make sure submitted images are identifiable

### Current Tasks: 
- Use LoG variance to threshold
- Use FFT to filter
